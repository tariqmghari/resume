**About me :** Currently on Master 2 in Burgundy university, DIJON FRANCE in Database and artificial intelligence, before joining this master I did an engineering degree in BIG DATA. 
Passionate about programming for a long time, in my first years of university I started with computer science degree, where I have learned algorithms along with programming languages, I also followed online courses, which made me skilled enough to start freelancing. Two years after, I choose BIG DATA engineering as my next degree, where I have learned many theoritical concepts mainly in linear algebra, optimization, signal processing and so on. The goal was to be able to use AI, to extract information from data. On my last year of engineering, I joined a company as an intern, where I had my first real professional experience, where I used DeepLearning, to build a recommendation system based on image content, where I got interested on this part of the job, which helped me decide to apply for an artificial intelligence degree in FRANCE, and currently I'm working as an intern on a deep learning project analyzing images using multi classification

> I never ask what programming language you want to use, you just need to know what to do and build the logic into achieving it, syntax is just a language that you can learn easily.

##### <u>WORK HISTORY:</u>

<span style ="color:Blue">**Data scientist Givaudan (Image Analysis)**</span>

<span style ="color:Cyan">Givaudan Paris April-september 2022</span>

Working on image multi label classification, using deep learning. Pytorch is the ML framework I'm using for this project

<span style ="color:Blue">**Data scientist**</span>

<span style ="color:Cyan">NEARYOU CONSULTING Rabat february-august  2021</span>

Working on an e-commerce project for a client to the company, to build a recommendation system for this website and offer it as a web service. Using content-based and collaborative filtering, I have made a recommendation system, where I have used a dataset of images of products, and studied the similarities using deep learning algorithms and cosine distance (Content-based filtering). I also used KNN to cluster similar users (Collaborative filtering)
